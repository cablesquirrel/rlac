For those that know me, it's no surprise that I'm always advocating for automation whenever I'm given a chance. Recently, myself and 2 of my coworkers were invited to participate in an
episode of the online podcast 'Network Automation Nerds' from Packet Pushers.

We had a blast talking about the challenges we faced trying to bring automation into a company that's trying to adapt to quickly expanding network. We tell the story of a recent event
that required delicate planning and collaboration, along with some custom tooling and monitoring solutions.

Grab a cup of coffee and take a listen as we tell our story. [Network Automation Nerds - Episode 83](https://packetpushers.net/podcasts/network-automation-nerds/nan083-cox-gets-network-automation-right-and-proves-it-at-def-con-sponsored/)
